Add a new public route that allows subscribing to the Brevo Module. By default, this route is disabled and can be enabled in the Brevo module configuration via `enablePublicApiSubscriptionRoute: true`. This feature allows external applications to create a newsletter form and subscribe via REST to the Brevo module.
